  facts:
  - Created a wall-crawling autonomous robot that followed and inspected a path of rivets on a plane.  The robot had the ability to have key parameters and thresholds set from and be controlled by a remote computer.
  - Developed a joystick controlled automatic foam dart gun using a Renesas development board and H-Bridge driver circuit.
  - Made a wearable facial twitch sensor that communicated via Bluetooth 3.0 with a Java application running on a remote computer. The project utilized MSP430 MCUs due to their low power operation mode.
